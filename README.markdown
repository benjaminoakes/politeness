Politeness
==========

Require your Ruby code to be more polite:  require 'politeness'

Inspired by INTERCAL, this library makes Ruby programmers say "please" more often.  If Ruby doesn't like how brash or cocky you're being, it will stop in the middle of your code and tell you so:

    "Not polite enough!"

However, you *can* say please too much.  In that case, Ruby will throw its hands up and tell you that you're:

    "Too polite!"

Most libraries are *very* rude, so be sure to require politeness after including them (unless you intend to make them a little more well-mannered).

There's an example in @example.rb@.
